30-Day Productivity Trend (Line chart)

Daily scores over time
Shows improvement trajectory
Weekly Heatmap (Calendar heatmap)

Which days are best/worst
Color intensity = productivity score
Time-of-Day Activity Area Graph

X-axis: Hours (6 AM → 11 PM)
Y-axis: Activity/Focus level (0-100%)
Labels: What activities preceded peaks
Example: "Peak at 9 AM after morning coffee ☕"
Focus vs Completion Scatter Plot

Shows correlation
Insight: "8+ focus = 90% completion rate"
Completion Rate Trends (Bar chart)

% of tasks completed per day
Week-over-week comparison
Focus-Completion Matrix (Quadrant chart)

High Focus + High Completion = 🟢 Optimal
High Focus + Low Completion = 🟡 Tasks too ambitious?
Low Focus + High Completion = 🟠 Boring tasks?
Low Focus + Low Completion = 🔴 Need help

🤖 AI Functionality
Gemini AI does:

Generate tomorrow's plan based on:

User's occupation & routine
Peak activity hours
Past feedback patterns
Completion rates at different times
Google Calendar events
Parse chat commands (structured outputs):

"Move task" → {action: "move", taskId, newTime}
"Add task" → {action: "add", task, time, priority}
"Delete task" → {action: "delete", taskId}
Learn from feedback:

Low focus after 2hrs → Add breaks
"Coffee" mentioned often → Schedule buffer after coffee time
High completion at 9 AM → Prioritize hard tasks there
Generate insights:

"You're 30% more productive after walks"
"Consider adding a break at 3 PM (focus drops 40%)"
