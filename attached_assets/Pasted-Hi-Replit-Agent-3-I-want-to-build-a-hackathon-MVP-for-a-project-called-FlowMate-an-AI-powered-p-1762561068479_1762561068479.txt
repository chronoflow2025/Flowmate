Hi Replit Agent 3, I want to build a hackathon MVP for a project called "FlowMate" — an AI-powered productivity assistant that generates personalized daily schedules based on focus patterns, task list, and calendar events. Please scaffold the full-stack project with the following requirements:

---

### 1. Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI) for API endpoints
- **AI:** Replit Agent 3 + optional OpenAI API calls for schedule generation
- **Database:** Replit DB (key-value storage)
- **Hosting/Deployment:** Replit deploy (full-stack)

---

### 2. Project Structure
- `/frontend` → Next.js frontend with:
  - Pages: `index` (dashboard), `feedback` (submit daily focus feedback)
  - Components: `Header`, `PlanCard`, `FocusGraph`, `FeedbackForm`
  - Tailwind configured for responsive UI
- `/backend` → Flask API with:
  - `/plan` (GET) → Returns AI-generated daily schedule JSON
  - `/feedback` (POST) → Stores user focus feedback in Replit DB
  - `ai_agent.py` → Handles communication with Replit Agent 3 / AI logic
- `/data` → Optional JSON storage for MVP
- `.replit` / `replit.nix` → Config for full-stack run

---

### 3. MVP Features
1. **AI Timesheet Generation**
   - Backend generates a simple daily schedule for next day
   - For hackathon MVP, heuristic-based focus prediction is okay
2. **Feedback Loop**
   - Users submit focus ratings (1–5) after completing day
   - Store in DB for next day's plan adjustments
3. **Dashboard**
   - Show today’s schedule
   - Show past focus trend as a simple graph
4. **Optional Integration**
   - Placeholder for Google Calendar API sync

---

### 4. Deployment Requirements
- The app should run directly on Replit and provide a **live URL**
- Frontend and backend should communicate seamlessly
- API endpoints must be functional and testable
- Minimal setup required; all dependencies managed via `package.json` (frontend) and `requirements.txt` (backend)

---

### 5. Code Quality & Extras
- Follow **modular folder structure**
- Include **README.md** with instructions to run the app
- Include placeholder sample data for focus logs
- Add comments in code explaining key logic
- Ensure the app is **hackathon-ready and demoable in <24 hours**

---

Please generate the full scaffold for this MVP including all files and folder structure. After scaffold, provide instructions on how to run, test, and deploy the project in Replit.
